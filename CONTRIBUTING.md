# Contributing to JavaMarkdown

If you're reading this, you're probably looking to contribute to the project. That's great! The goal of this document is to introduce a bit of the structure with contributions and how to add to this project.


> I just wrote a block of text, realized it was too long, and then decided to write this. For that... you're welcome

- I'm unsure (or I have decided) how I will manage different flavors of markdown. That is still to be determined
- The issues tab is an ongoing list of tasks that need to be completed. If you want to contribute, this is the key place to go
- Steps for contributing
  1. Pick an issue
  2. Reply to the issue letting us know that you wish to work on it
  3. Fork the repo. Create a branch on your fork if you wish
  4. Solve the issue, push changes to the fork
  5. Make a pull request, please ensure that the issue number is included in the pull request description
  6. We'll take a look at it, link it to the pull request if it solves it, and merge it once all the tests sort out!
