# Java Markdown


A simple Java package to write markdown-formatted strings. In very early stages of development.

Major versions will be denoted with n by `0.n.?`. This is because I will let it automatically update whenever there is any "dependabot" or small patches made. Therefore, I'm going to indicate that `0.0.?` is the pre-initial-release, and should not be taken as the final product
